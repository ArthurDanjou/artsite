Hey, I'm :home-name, a :hover-text{text="Master 2 student in Statistical & Financial Engineering (Master ISF)" hover="Université Paris-Dauphine - PSL" position="bottom"} at Paris-Dauphine University.

I sit at the intersection of :hover-text{hover="Learning Theory, RL & Advanced ML 🧠" position="top" text="theoretical research"} and :hover-text{hover="From MLOps to Production 🚀" position="right" text="software engineering"}. Unlike a pure theorist, I build what I model. Unlike a pure developer, I understand the math behind the code.

I am dedicating my research to :hover-text{hover="Alignment, Robustness & Interpretability 🧭" text="AI Safety"}. I will soon start my Master's Thesis focusing on :hover-text{hover="Adversarial Defenses & Formal Verification 🛡️" text="Cybersecurity"} and :hover-text{hover="Ensuring AI alignment and stability 🤝" text="Safe Deep Learning"}, exploring how to make AI systems mathematically robust and secure.

To drive this research, I leverage
:prose-icon[Python]{color="amber" icon="i-logos:python"},
:prose-icon[PyTorch]{color="orange" icon="i-logos:pytorch-icon"} and
:prose-icon[R]{color="blue" icon="i-logos:r-lang"} to design architectures, relying on
:prose-icon[Docker]{color="sky" icon="i-logos:docker-icon"} and
:prose-icon[Linux]{color="zinc" icon="i-logos:linux-tux"} to ensure reproducibility within my :hover-text{hover="I self-host my own GPU cluster 🔌" text="homelab"}.

When I'm not deriving generalization bounds or fixing pipelines, I enjoy :hover-text{hover="Former Team Captain 🏉" text="Rugby"} and :hover-text{hover="Exploring the world 🌍" text="Traveling"}.
