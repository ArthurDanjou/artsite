Hey, I'm Arthur Danjou, a mathematics student at the Paris-Saclay Faculty of Science in France.

With a **deep understanding of emerging technologies**, I'm at the heart of a rapidly expanding field. My background in **mathematics** gives me a head start in understanding the concepts and theories behind these **technologies** and in designing them effectively.

As a software engineer and mathematics student, my **expertise** covers

<AIcon icon="i-logos:java">Java</AIcon>,
<AIcon icon="i-logos:python">Python</AIcon>,
<AIcon icon="i-logos:r-lang">R</AIcon>, which enables me to **understand** the different needs of mathematical projects and to propose the best solutions.


I'm **constantly** learning new things, from technology to finance and entrepreneurship. I love **sharing** my knowledge and learning new theorems and technologies. I'm a **curious** person and eager to continue learning and growing throughout my life.

As well as programming, I enjoy **sport** and **travelling**. My passion, commitment and eagerness to learn and progress are the qualities that enable me to succeed in my **career** and **studies**.
