Hey, I'm Arthur Danjou, a mathematics student at the Paris-Saclay Faculty of Science in France.

With a **deep understanding of emerging technologies**, I'm at the heart of a rapidly expanding field. My background in **mathematics** gives me a head start in understanding the concepts and theories behind these **technologies** and in designing them effectively.

As a software engineer and mathematics student, my **expertise** covers
:prose-icon[TypeScript]{icon="i-logos:typescript-icon"},
:prose-icon[Vue]{icon="i-logos:vue"},
:prose-icon[Nuxt]{icon="i-logos:nuxt-icon"},
:prose-icon[Adonis]{icon="i-logos:adonisjs-icon"},
:prose-icon[Java]{icon="i-logos:java"},
:prose-icon[Python]{icon="i-logos:python"},
:prose-icon[R]{icon="i-logos:r-lang"}, which enables me to **understand** the different needs of mathematical projects
and to propose the best solutions.
I also learned other important technologies, such as
:prose-icon[Docker]{icon="i-logos:docker-icon"},
:prose-icon[Redis]{icon="i-logos:redis"},
:prose-icon[MySQL]{icon="i-logos:mysql-icon"} and
:prose-icon[Git]{icon="i-logos:git-icon"} to **improve** and **complete** my knowledge.

I'm **constantly** learning new things, from technology to finance and entrepreneurship. I love **sharing** my knowledge and learning new theorems and technologies. I'm a **curious** person and eager to continue learning and growing throughout my life.

As well as programming, I enjoy **sport** and **travelling**. My passion, commitment and eagerness to learn and progress are the qualities that enable me to succeed in my **career** and **studies**.
