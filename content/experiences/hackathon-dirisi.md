title: Hackathon CND - Machine Learning for Cybersecurity
type: Hackathon
company: Commissariat au numérique de défense (CND), French Armies ministry
companyUrl: https://www.defense.gouv.fr/cnd
location: Fort du Mont-Valérien, Suresnes, France
startDate: 2025-11
endDate: 2025-11
duration: 3 days
description: Developed a Python ML pipeline during the Dirisi hackathon to classify system logs for bug and attack detection. Implemented feature extraction and preprocessing, trained and evaluated models (tree-based and lightweight neural), tuned thresholds to favor recall, and delivered a realtime prototype with visualization and reproducible code in collaboration with CND engineers. Implemented a Streamlit application to test the classifier interactively and used an LLM to generate contextual help explaining the likely origin and indicators of detected bugs or attacks for end users.
