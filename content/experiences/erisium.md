description: At Erisium, one of the most popular French-speaking Minecraft servers, I worked as a Junior Java Developer. I developed mini-games designed by the game design team, and worked on backend infrastructure optimizations to handle several thousand concurrent players. This experience allowed me to solve a wide range of complex bugs and to grow within a collaborative, high-performance technical environment.
