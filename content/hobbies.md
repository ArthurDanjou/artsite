# Beyond the Lab

Research demands deep focus, but breakthrough ideas often come from stepping back. I believe that **cognitive flexibility**—the ability to switch between intense analytical work and creative exploration—is key to sustaining long-term performance in AI.

I am drawn to environments where strategy, speed, and precision intersect. These are not just pastimes, but exercises in optimization under constraints.

**Formula 1 Enthusiast**
I am fascinated by F1 as the pinnacle of **real-time optimization**. Decisions are made in milliseconds based on :hover-text{text="telemetry data" hover="Tyre degradation, fuel load, weather"}, mirroring the constraints of deploying ML models in production.
* **Focus:** The intersection of human instinct and data-driven strategy.

**Rugby & Volleyball**
Team sports are my foundation for resilience. As a :hover-text{text="former Rugby Team Captain" hover="School Championships Participant"}, I learned that leadership isn't about giving orders—it's about maintaining cohesion under pressure.
* **Takeaway:** Collective intelligence always outperforms individual brilliance.

**Travel & Adaptation**
Exposure to diverse systems fosters adaptability. From the history of **Egypt** and the landscapes of **South Africa** to the vibrancy of **Thailand** and the **USA**, every environment challenges my default way of thinking.
* **Goal:** Understanding complex systems by observing different cultures.

**Paris Saint-Germain**
As a long-time supporter of **PSG**, I appreciate the tactical analysis and performance management at the highest level. Football is a game of :hover-text{text="spatial optimization" hover="Controlling space & transitions"}, much like architecting a neural network.

**Music** serves as my cognitive reset. Training my ear to recognize harmony and structure translates directly to identifying elegant solutions in system design. It reinforces my belief that great engineering, like great music, requires both **technical precision** and **artistic intuition**.
