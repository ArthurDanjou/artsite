This project involves creating an interactive data visualization application using R and R Shiny. The goal is to develop dynamic and explorable visualizations that allow users to interact with the data in meaningful ways.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **[R](https://www.r-project.org)**: A statistical computing environment, perfect for data analysis and visualization.
- **[R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com)**: A web application framework for R that enables the creation of interactive web applications directly from R.
- **[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)**: A powerful R package for creating static and dynamic visualizations using the Grammar of Graphics.
- **[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)**: An R package for data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs to help you solve common data manipulation challenges.
- **[tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org)**: An R package for tidying data, making it easier to work with and visualize.

The project is currently in progress, and more details will be added as development continues.
