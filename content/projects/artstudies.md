# ArtStudies

[ArtStudies Projects](https://github.com/ArthurDanjou/artstudies) is a curated collection of academic projects completed throughout my mathematics studies. The repository showcases work in both _Python_ and _R_, focusing on mathematical modeling, data analysis, and numerical methods.

The projects are organized into two main sections:
- **L3** – Third year of the Bachelor's degree in Mathematics
- **M1** – First year of the Master's degree in Mathematics
- **M2** – Second year of the Master's degree in Mathematics
