[**ArtChat**](https://go.arthurdanjou.fr/website) is my personal space on the web — a portfolio, a blog, and a digital lab where I showcase my projects, write about topics I care about, and experiment with design and web technologies.

It's designed to be fast, accessible, and fully responsive. The site also serves as a playground to explore and test modern frontend tools.
