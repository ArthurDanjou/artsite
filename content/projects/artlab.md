[**ArtLab**](https://go.arthurdanjou.fr/status) is my personal homelab, where I experiment with self-hosting and automation.

My homelab is a self-hosted environment where I deploy, test, and maintain personal services. Everything is securely exposed **only through a private VPN** using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), ensuring encrypted, access-controlled connections across all devices.
For selected services, I also use **Cloudflare Tunnels** to enable secure external access without opening ports or exposing my public IP.
