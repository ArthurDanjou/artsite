[Studies Projects](https://github.com/ArthurDanjou/studies) is a curated collection of academic projects completed throughout my mathematics studies. The repository showcases work in both _Python_ and _R_, focusing on mathematical modeling, data analysis, and numerical methods.

The projects are organized into two main sections:
- **L3** ‚Äì Third year of the Bachelor's degree in Mathematics
- **M1** ‚Äì First year of the Master's degree in Mathematics

## üìÅ File Structure

- `L3`
  - `Analyse Matricielle`
  - `Analyse Multidimensionnelle`
  - `Calculs Num√©riques`
  - `√âquations Diff√©rentielles`
  - `M√©thodes Num√©riques`
  - `Probabilit√©s`
  - `Projet Num√©rique`
  - `Statistiques`

- `M1`
  - `Data Analysis`
  - `General Linear Models`
  - `Monte Carlo Methods`
  - `Numerical Methods`
  - `Numerical Optimization`
  - `Portfolio Management`
  - `Statistical Learning`
