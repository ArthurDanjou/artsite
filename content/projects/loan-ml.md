# Machine Learning for Loan Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict loan approval outcomes and assess default risk. The objective is to develop robust classification models that can effectively identify creditworthy applicants.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Build and compare multiple classification models for loan prediction
- Identify key factors influencing loan approval decisions
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Optimize model parameters for better predictive accuracy

## 🔍 Methodology

The study employs various machine learning approaches:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding applicant characteristics and patterns
- **Feature Engineering** - Creating meaningful features from raw data
- **Model Comparison** - Testing multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Optimizing model performance
- **Cross-validation** - Ensuring robust generalization
