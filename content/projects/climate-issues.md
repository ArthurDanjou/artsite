## Overview

This project is a detailed study of **wind risk assessment and modeling** in the context of natural disasters, using the **December 1999 Martin Storm** as a case study. The analysis combines statistical methods, meteorological data, and spatial analysis techniques to understand and quantify the impacts of extreme wind events.

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this research were:

1. **Characterize extreme meteorological events** and their propagation patterns
2. **Model wind risk** using statistical and probabilistic approaches
3. **Assess spatial distribution** of hazards using GIS mapping techniques
4. **Quantify economic and environmental impacts** of the storm
5. **Develop predictive models** for future risk assessment and disaster preparedness

## 📊 Methodology

### Data Sources
- Historical meteorological records from the 1999 Martin Storm
- Wind speed measurements from weather stations across France
- Satellite imagery and atmospheric pressure data
- Damage assessments and economic loss records

### Analytical Techniques
- **Time-series analysis** of wind speed and atmospheric pressure
- **Spatial interpolation** using kriging and other geostatistical methods
- **Probability distribution fitting** (Weibull, Gumbel, and Log-Normal distributions)
- **Return period estimation** for extreme wind events
- **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** for hazard mapping and visualization

### Statistical Models
- Extreme Value Theory (EVT) for tail risk analysis
- Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions
- Peak-over-threshold (POT) methods
- Spatial correlation analysis

## 🌍 Key Findings

The analysis revealed:
- Wind speeds exceeding 100 km/h across multiple regions
- Non-uniform spatial distribution of damage intensity
- Correlation patterns between meteorological variables and structural damage
- Seasonal and geographical risk variations
- Return period estimations for comparable extreme events

## 💡 Applications

The methodologies developed in this project have applications in:
- **Disaster risk reduction and preparedness** planning
- **Insurance and risk assessment** for natural hazards
- **Urban planning** and infrastructure resilience
- **Climate adaptation** strategies
- **Early warning systems** for extreme weather events
