This report presents the Monte Carlo Methods Project completed as part of the **Monte Carlo Methods** course at Paris-Dauphine University. The goal was to implement different methods and algorithms using Monte Carlo methods in R.

## 🛠️ Methods and Algorithms

- Plotting graphs of functions
- Inverse c.d.f. Random Variation simulation
- Accept-Reject Random Variation simulation
- Random Variable simulation with stratification
- Cumulative density function
- Empirical Quantile Function
