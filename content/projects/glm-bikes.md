This project was completed as part of the **Generalized Linear Models** course at Paris-Dauphine PSL University. The objective was to develop and compare statistical models that predict bicycle rentals in a bike-sharing system using environmental and temporal features.

::BackgroundTitle{title="Project Objectives"}
::

- Determine the best predictive model for bicycle rental counts
- Analyze the impact of key features (temperature, humidity, wind speed, seasonality, etc.)
- Apply and evaluate different generalized linear modeling techniques
- Validate model assumptions and performance metrics

::BackgroundTitle{title="Methodology"}
::

The study uses a rigorous statistical workflow, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Understanding feature distributions and relationships
- **Model Comparison** - Testing multiple GLM families (Poisson, Negative Binomial, Gaussian)
- **Feature Selection** - Identifying the most influential variables
- **Model Diagnostics** - Validating assumptions and checking residuals
- **Cross-validation** - Ensuring robust performance estimates

::BackgroundTitle{title="Key Findings"}
::

The analysis identified critical factors influencing bike-sharing demand:
- Seasonal patterns and weather conditions
- Temperature and humidity effects
- Holiday and working day distinctions
- Time-based trends and cyclical patterns
