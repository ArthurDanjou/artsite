This is the report for the Monte Carlo Methods Project. The project was done as part of the course `Monte Carlo Methods` at the Paris-Dauphine University. The goal was to implement different methods and algorithms using Monte Carlo methods in R.

Methods and algorithms implemented:
- Plotting graphs of functions
- Inverse c.d.f. Random Variation simulation
- Accept-Reject Random Variation simulation
- Random Variable simulation with stratification
- Cumulative density function
- Empirical Quantile Function
