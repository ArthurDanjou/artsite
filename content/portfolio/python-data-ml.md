[Python Data & ML](https://github.com/ArthurDanjou/Python-Data-Machine-Learning) is a repository dedicated to learning and practicing Python libraries for machine learning. It includes a variety of projects and exercises that cover the following topics.
This project explores tools like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and others to understand and master key machine learning concepts. Perfect for strengthening skills in data processing, modeling, and algorithm optimization. 

The goal is to improve my level of understanding of machine learning and data science concepts, as well as to practice Python programming and using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, etc., to manipulate and analyze data, during my free time.
