[Studies projects](https://github.com/ArthurDanjou/studies) is a collection of mathematics projects done during my studies. It includes projects in _Python_ and in _R_.

The projects are divided into two main categories: _L3_ and _M1_, corresponding to the third year of the bachelor's degree and the first year of the master's degree in mathematics.

File structure:
- `L3`
  - `Analyse Matricielle`
  - `Analyse Multidimensionnelle`
  - `Calculs Num√©riques`
  - `Equations Diff√©rentielles`
  - `M√©thodes Num√©riques`
  - `Probabilit√©s`
  - `Projet Num√©rique`
  - `Statistiques`
- `M1`
  - `Data Analysis`
  - `General Linear Models`
  - `Monte Carlo Methods`
  - `Portfolio Management`

Made with:
- [Python](https://www.python.org): Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
- [R](https://www.r-project.org): R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org): Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of the Python programming language.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org): NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
- [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org): SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific and technical computing.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org): Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com): R Markdown is an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to save and execute code and generate high-quality reports that can be shared with an audience.
- [FactoMineR](https://factominer.free.fr/): FactoMineR is an R package dedicated to multivariate exploratory data analysis.
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org): ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.
