Hey, I'm Arthur Danjou, a Mathematics student in Statistics at the Paris-Dauphine University in France.

With a :hover-text{hover="Technology is evolving far too quickly 🤯" position="top" text="deep understanding"} of
emerging technologies, I'm at the heart of a rapidly expanding field. My background in :hover-text{hover="Maths is my main passion ∑" position="right" text="mathematics"} gives me a head start in
understanding the concepts and theories behind these :hover-text{hover="My second passion 📱" text="technologies"} and in designing them effectively.

As a software engineer and mathematics student, my :hover-text{hover="My bag of knowledge 🎒" text="expertise"} covers
:prose-icon[TypeScript]{icon="typescript-icon" color="blue"},
:prose-icon[Vue]{icon="vue" color="green"},
:prose-icon[Nuxt]{icon="nuxt-icon" color="emerald"},
:prose-icon[Adonis]{icon="adonisjs-icon" color="purple"},
:prose-icon[Java]{icon="java" color="red"},
:prose-icon[Python]{icon="python" color="amber"},
:prose-icon[R]{icon="r-lang" color="blue"},
which enables me to :hover-text{hover="need to quickly understand the complexity of projects 🏎️" text="understand"} the different needs of mathematical projects and to propose the best solutions. I also learned other important technologies, such as
:prose-icon[Docker]{icon="docker-icon" color="sky"},
:prose-icon[Redis]{icon="redis" color="red"},
:prose-icon[MySQL]{icon="mysql-icon" color="zinc"} and
:prose-icon[Git]{icon="git-icon" color="orange"} to :hover-text{hover="All these technologies complement each other 🔗" text="complete"} my knowledge.

I'm :hover-text{hover="As tech is always evolving, I need to be up-to-date 🖥️" position="top" text="constantly"}
learning new things, from technology to finance and entrepreneurship. I love :hover-text{hover="I love sharing my knowledge and helping others 🫂" text="sharing"}
my knowledge and learning new theorems and technologies. I'm a :hover-text{hover="I'm constantly looking to discover new things" text="curious"} person and eager to continue learning and growing throughout my life.

As well as programming, I enjoy :hover-text{hover="Sport allows me to burn off energy 🏋️‍♂️" text="sport"} and
:hover-text{hover="Travelling frees me and gets me away from it all ✈️" text="travelling"}. My passion, commitment and
eagerness to learn and progress are the qualities that enable me to succeed in my :hover-text{hover="Career already
begun and far from over 😎" text="career"} and :hover-text{hover="Only 2 years of study left 💪" text="studies"}.
