Hey, I'm Arthur Danjou, a Mathematics student in Statistics at the Paris-Dauphine University in France.

With a :hover-text{hover="Technology is evolving far too quickly ü§Ø" position="top" text="deep understanding"} of emerging technologies, I'm at the heart of a rapidly expanding field. My background in :hover-text{hover="Maths is my main passion ‚àë" position="right" text="mathematics"} gives me a head start in understanding the concepts and theories behind these :hover-text{hover="My second passion üì±" text="technologies"} and in designing them effectively.

As a software engineer and mathematics student, my :hover-text{hover="My bag of knowledge üéí" text="expertise"} covers
:prose-icon[TypeScript]{icon="i-logos:typescript-icon" color="blue"},
:prose-icon[Vue]{icon="i-logos:vue" color="green"},
:prose-icon[Nuxt]{icon="i-logos:nuxt-icon" color="emerald"},
:prose-icon[Adonis]{icon="i-logos:adonisjs-icon" color="purple"},
:prose-icon[Java]{icon="i-logos:java" color="red"},
:prose-icon[Python]{icon="i-logos:python" color="amber"},
:prose-icon[R]{icon="i-logos:r-lang" color="blue"}, which enables me to :hover-text{hover="Need to quickly understand the complexity of projects üèéÔ∏è" text="understand"} the different needs of mathematical projects and to propose the best solutions.
I use tools like
:prose-icon[scikit-learn]{icon="devicon-scikitlearn" color="orange"} for supervised learning,
:prose-icon[pandas]{icon="i-logos:pandas-icon" color="blue"} for efficient data manipulation,
:prose-icon[NumPy]{icon="i-logos:numpy" color="indigo"} for scientific computation, and
:prose-icon[TensorFlow]{icon="i-logos:tensorflow" color="orange"} to build and train deep learning models.  
I also learned other important technologies, such as
:prose-icon[Docker]{icon="i-logos:docker-icon" color="sky"},
:prose-icon[Redis]{icon="i-logos:redis" color="red"},
:prose-icon[MySQL]{icon="i-logos:mysql-icon" color="zinc"} and
:prose-icon[Git]{icon="i-logos:git-icon" color="orange"} to :hover-text{hover="All these technologies complement each other üîó" text="complete"} my knowledge.

These tools allow me to go from :hover-text{hover="Exploration, cleaning, reshaping‚Ä¶" text="data preparation"} to :hover-text{hover="Training, evaluation, deployment" text="deployment"} of models in real-world environments, with statistical rigor and performance in mind. I'm passionate about AI and :hover-text{hover="AI is the future of technology ü§ñ" text="data science"}.

I'm :hover-text{hover="As tech is always evolving, I need to be up-to-date üñ•Ô∏è" position="top" text="constantly"} learning new things, from technology to finance and entrepreneurship. I love :hover-text{hover="I love sharing my knowledge and helping others ü´Ç" text="sharing"} my knowledge and learning new theorems and technologies. I'm a :hover-text{hover="I'm constantly looking to discover new things" text="curious"} person and eager to continue learning and growing throughout my life.

As well as programming, I enjoy :hover-text{hover="Sport allows me to burn off energy üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" text="sport"} and :hover-text{hover="Travelling frees me and gets me away from it all ‚úàÔ∏è" text="travelling"}. My passion, commitment and eagerness to learn and progress are the qualities that enable me to succeed in my :hover-text{hover="Career already begun and far from over üòé" text="career"} and :hover-text{hover="Only 2 years of study left üí™" text="studies"}.
