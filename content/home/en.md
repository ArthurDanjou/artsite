Hey, I'm :home-name , a Mathematics student in Statistics at the Paris-Dauphine University in France.

With a :hover-text{hover="Technology is evolving far too quickly ü§Ø" position="top" text="deep understanding"} of emerging technologies, I'm at the heart of a rapidly expanding field. My background in :hover-text{hover="Maths is my main passion ‚àë" position="right" text="mathematics"} gives me a head start in understanding the concepts and theories behind these :hover-text{hover="My second passion üì±" text="technologies"} and in designing them effectively.

As a software engineer and mathematics student, my :hover-text{hover="My bag of knowledge üéí" text="expertise"} covers
:prose-icon[TypeScript]{color="blue" icon="i-logos:typescript-icon"} ,
:prose-icon[Vue]{color="green" icon="i-logos:vue"} ,
:prose-icon[Nuxt]{color="emerald" icon="i-logos:nuxt-icon"} ,
:prose-icon[Adonis]{color="purple" icon="i-logos:adonisjs-icon"} ,
:prose-icon[Java]{color="red" icon="i-logos:java"} ,
:prose-icon[Python]{color="amber" icon="i-logos:python"} ,
:prose-icon[R]{color="blue" icon="i-logos:r-lang"} , which enables me to :hover-text{hover="Need to quickly understand the complexity of projects üèéÔ∏è" text="understand"} the different needs of mathematical projects and to propose the best solutions.
I use tools like
:prose-icon[scikit-learn]{color="orange" icon="devicon-scikitlearn"} for supervised learning,
:prose-icon[pandas]{color="blue" icon="i-logos:pandas-icon"} for efficient data manipulation,
:prose-icon[NumPy]{color="indigo" icon="i-logos:numpy"} for scientific computation, and
:prose-icon[TensorFlow]{color="orange" icon="i-logos:tensorflow"} as well as :prose-icon[PyTorch]{color="orange" icon="i-logos:pytorch-icon"} to build and train deep learning models.
I also learned other important technologies, such as
:prose-icon[Docker]{color="sky" icon="i-logos:docker-icon"} ,
:prose-icon[Redis]{color="red" icon="i-logos:redis"} ,
:prose-icon[MySQL]{color="zinc" icon="i-logos:mysql-icon"} and
:prose-icon[Git]{color="orange" icon="i-logos:git-icon"} to :hover-text{hover="All these technologies complement each other üîó" text="complete"} my knowledge.

These tools allow me to go from :hover-text{hover="Exploration, cleaning, reshaping‚Ä¶" text="data preparation"} to :hover-text{hover="Training, evaluation, deployment" text="deployment"} of models in real-world environments, with statistical rigor and performance in mind. I'm passionate about AI and :hover-text{hover="AI is the future of technology ü§ñ" text="data science"} .

I'm :hover-text{hover="As tech is always evolving, I need to be up-to-date üñ•Ô∏è" position="top" text="constantly"} learning new things, from technology to finance and entrepreneurship. I love :hover-text{hover="I love sharing my knowledge and helping others ü´Ç" text="sharing"} my knowledge and learning new theorems and technologies. I'm a :hover-text{hover="I'm constantly looking to discover new things" text="curious"} person and eager to continue learning and growing throughout my life.

As well as programming, I enjoy :hover-text{hover="Sport allows me to burn off energy üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" text="sport"} and :hover-text{hover="Travelling frees me and gets me away from it all ‚úàÔ∏è" text="travelling"} . My passion, commitment and eagerness to learn and progress are the qualities that enable me to succeed in my :hover-text{hover="Career already begun and far from over üòé" text="career"} and :hover-text{hover="Only 2 years of study left üí™" text="studies"} .
