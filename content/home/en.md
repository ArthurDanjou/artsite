Hey, I'm Arthur Danjou, a mathematics student at the Paris-Saclay Faculty of Science in France.

With a :hover-text{hover="Technology is evolving far too quickly 🤯" position="top" text="deep understanding of emerging technologies"}, I'm at the heart of a rapidly expanding field. My background in :hover-text{hover="Maths is my main passion ∑" position="right" text="mathematics"} gives me a head start in
understanding the
concepts and theories behind these :hover-text{hover="My second passion 📱" text="technologies"} and in designing them
effectively.

As a software engineer and mathematics student, my :hover-text{hover="My bag of knowledge 🎒" text="expertise"} covers
:prose-icon[TypeScript]{icon="i-logos-typescript-icon"},
:prose-icon[Vue]{icon="i-logos:vue"},
:prose-icon[Nuxt]{icon="i-logos:nuxt-icon"},
:prose-icon[Adonis]{icon="i-logos:adonisjs-icon"},
:prose-icon[Java]{icon="i-logos:java"},
:prose-icon[Python]{icon="i-logos:python"},
:prose-icon[R]{icon="i-logos:r-lang"},
which enables me to :hover-text{hover="need to quickly understand the complexity of projects 🏎️" text="understand"} the
different needs of mathematical projects and to propose the best solutions.
I also learned other important technologies, such as
:prose-icon[Docker]{icon="i-logos:docker-icon"},
:prose-icon[Redis]{icon="i-logos:redis"},
:prose-icon[MySQL]{icon="i-logos:mysql-icon"} and
:prose-icon[Git]{icon="i-logos:git-icon"} to :hover-text{hover="All these technologies complement each other 🔗" text="complete"} my knowledge.

I'm :hover-text{hover="As tech is always evolving, I need to be up-to-date 🖥️" position="top" text="constantly"} learning new things, from technology to finance and entrepreneurship. I love :hover-text{hover="I love sharing my knowledge and helping
others 🫂" text="sharing"} my knowledge and learning new theorems and technologies. I'm a :hover-text{hover="I'm constantly looking to discover new things" text="curious"} person and eager to continue learning and growing throughout my life.

As well as programming, I enjoy :hover-text{hover="Sport allows me to burn off energy 🏋️‍♂️" text="sport"} and
:hover-text{hover="Travelling frees me and gets me away from it all ✈️" text="travelling"}. My passion, commitment and eagerness to learn and progress are the qualities that enable me to succeed in my :hover-text{hover="Career already begun and far from over 😎" text="career"} and :hover-text{hover="Only 2 years of study left 💪" text="studies"}.
